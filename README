Noise removal of hyperspectral images using the MNF transform. See --help. 

For use of this source code, please cite A. Bjorgan, L. L. Randeberg, "Real-time noise removal
for line-scanning hyperspectral devices using a Minimum Noise Fraction-based approach", Sensors X(x), pp. XX-XX (2014). DOI:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.

RUNNING
mnf is run from the command line. ./mnf filename --option1 --option2 ..., or mnf.exe filename --option1 --option2 ... . 

Conventional MNF is run when the --line-by-line option is not set. A modification running statistics updates
and noise removal line by line is run when the --line-by-line option is set.
